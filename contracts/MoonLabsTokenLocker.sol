/**
 * @title A token locker contract for ERC20 tokens.
 * @author Moon Labs LLC
 * @notice This contract's intended purpose is to allow users to create token locks for ERC20 tokens. Lock creators may extend, transfer, add to, and
 * split locks. Lock creators may NOT unlock tokens prematurely for whatever reason. Tokens locked in this contract remain locked until their
 * respective unlock date without ANY exceptions. To maximize gas efficiency, this contract is not suited to handle rebasing tokens or tokens in
 * which a wallets supply changes based on total supply.
